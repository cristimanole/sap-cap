//The HeaderInfo describes the key information of the object, which will make the object page to display title of the risk as title and the descr as subtitle in its header area.
//The SelectionFields section defines which of the properties are exposed as search fields in the header bar above the list. In this case, prio is the only explicit search field.
//The columns and their order in the work list are derived from the LineItem section. While in most cases the columns are defined by Value: followed by the property name of the entity, in the case of prio and impact thereâ€™s also Criticality. For now, you can neglect it but keep it in mind in case you go to the later modules.
//Facets section defines the content of the object page. It contains only a single facet, a ReferenceFacet, of the field group FieldGroup#Main. This field group just shows up as a form. The properties of the Data array within FieldGroup#Main determine the fields in the form.
//The line Text: miti.description , TextArrangement: #TextOnly, declares that the text from the description property is displayed for the miti association. Then it adds a value help (ValueList) for that association, so the user can pick one of the available mitigations when editing the object page.
